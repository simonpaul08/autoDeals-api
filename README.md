# Auto Deals API


###Installation
                
----

Clone the repo - https://github.com/simonpaul08/autoDeals-api
- Run the below command to install the node modules required to run the project

- `$ npm install`

- Once completed, create a new file called *.env*  in the root of the project.
- Create two env variables `PORT` and `MONGO_URI`

- Set the port to whatever port you want, by default it is 3000. For Mongo URI, you need to create a clustor on MONGO DB, take the URI from there and paste it in the env.
- `MONGO_URI=Your_URI`

- You can install nodemon `npm i nodemon --save-dev`, as `npm run dev` will trigger nodemon. 

- If you have nodemon installed, type `npm run dev` and the server will start running.

- If you don't have nodemon, then type `npm start`, it will do the job.

- Once the server is running, you can clone the client (mentioned above) and get the project running in your local.
